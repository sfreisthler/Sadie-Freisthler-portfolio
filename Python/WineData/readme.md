## Wine Data Analysis

**Wine.py** is a program that trains and implements a model to predict the color of a wine (red or white) using datasets. This program uses the 
nearest centroid classifier model. Due to the small size of the data set, I also implented k-fold cross validation to improve the accuracy of 
predictions.
