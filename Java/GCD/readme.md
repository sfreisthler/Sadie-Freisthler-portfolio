## GCD.java

### Description
This program calculates the greatest common devisor of two numbers both recursively and iteratively. 

The main method demonstrates error handeling through the use of try/catch blocks to catch errors in the user submitted command line arguments.
For example, too many/few arguments or incorrect format of inputs.
